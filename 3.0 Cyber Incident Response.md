## Cyber Incident Response

Security event and security incident are not the same thing. NIST offers standard definitions for these.

- A security event is any observable occurrence in a system or network that related to a security function. Example of these: user accessing a file store on a server, admin changing permissions, and an attacker conducting a port scan.

- An adverse event is any event that has negative consequences. Example: malware infectiono on system, server crash, user accessing a file that they are unauthorzied to see. 

- A security incident is a violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practises. Examples: accedental loss of sensitive info, an intrusion into a computer system by an attacker, the use of a keylogger on an execs system, and launch of DoS attack.

**Every security incident includes one or more security events, but not every security event is a security incident**

- Computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) are responsible for responding to computer security incidents that occur within an organization by following standardized response proc and incorporating their subject matter expertise and prof judgment.

  <summary> Phases of Incident Response</summary>
    <br>
    Members of CSIRTs must respond calmly and consistently in the event of a security incident. 
  There needs to be a well thoughtout and refinded process that describes how to handle the security incident. 
  
  Simple incident response process by NIST:

There are loops that allow responders to return to prior phases as needed. For example the containment process often includes several loops back through the detection and analysis phase to identify if the incident has been successfuly resolved. 

##Preparation

Gather the hardware, software, and info req to conduct an incident investigation. NIST Recommendations:

- Digital forensic workstations 
- Backup devices
- Laptops for data collection, analysis, and reporting
- Spare server and networking equipment
- Blank removable drive
- portable printer
- Forensic and packet cap software
- Bootable USB media containing trusted copies of forensic tools
- Office supplies and evidence collection materials

Planning is not one and done, whenever the Org is not actively invloved in an incident response effort, it should be planning for the next incident. 

## Detection and Analysis

One of the trickiest to commit to a routine process. Even with tools, many incidents are only detected bc of the trained eye of an experienced analyst. 

NIST 800-61 describes 4 major categories of security event indicatiors:

- Alerts: IDS, SIEM, AV, file integrity, or other monitoring 

- Logs: from any system or app

- Publicly available info: about new vulns in the wild or in a controlled env 

- People: inside or outside org that report suspicious activity that may indicate a security incident is in progress.


When any of these sources suggest a security incident, you should shift into the initial validation mode to determine of the incident is taking place and needs further action of the incident reponse process. 

NIST recommendtations for improving incident analysis effectiveness:

- Profile networks and systems to measure the characteristics of expected activity. 
- Understand normal behaviour of users, systems, networks, and apps
- Create a logging policy that specifies the info that must be logged by systems, apps, and network devices and where it is store and retention. 
- Perform event correlation to combine info from multiple sources (SIEM)
- Sync clocks across servers, workstations, and network devices for correlation of logs. (NTP) 
- Maintain an org wide knowledge base that contains critical info about systems and apps.
- capture network traffic as soon as an incident is suspected
- Filter info to reduce clutter. May have predefined filters during the prep phase to assist with further analysis.
- Seek assistance from external resources. This can be from googling an error code to coordinating with other response teams


## Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

  First passive activities to uncover and analyze info about the incident. Then active measures contain the effects of the incident, eradicate it from the network, and recover normal operations. 
  High level overview:
  
  - 1: Select containment strategy appropriate to the incident circumstances.
  - 2: Implement containment strategy to limit damage caused by incident.
  - 3: Gather additional evidence, to support response effort and potental legal action.
  - 4: Identify attacker(s) and attacking system(s)
  - 5: Eradicate the effects of the incident and recover normal business operations. 
  
  
  
## Post Incident Activity 

 This is for lessons learned and review internal and external evidence meet retention requirements.
 
 ### Lessons learned 
 
 Review of the incident and response to find ways to improve proc and tools for next incident.
