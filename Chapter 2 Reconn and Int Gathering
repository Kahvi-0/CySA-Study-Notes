Mixture of info gathering techniques that will allow you to be able to make a map of an organization's networks, systems, 
and other infrastructure. These can be broken down into Active and Passice reconn.

Active:
 Any reconn that involves "touching" the targets systems.
 - host scanning
 - vulnerability scanning
 
Note: Scans can disrupt services on target systems, so make sure you have permission (can be illegal).
Big cloub providers such as MS Azure and Amazon Web Servics require a vulnerability or Pen Test Form 
before using their infrastructure for scans.

Traceroute, TTL, and responses from devices help map the targets Topology.

When using tools that generate a topology based on scans keep in mind that info may not be 100% accurate.

When scanning keep variables in mind such as wireless vs wired network and if there are VMs on scanned devices.

Port scanners:
 Host Discovery -
 Port Scanning/ Service ID -
 Service Version ID - 
 OS ID - 

PORTS: 
 Well Known or System Ports - 0 to 1023
 Registered - 1024 to 49151
