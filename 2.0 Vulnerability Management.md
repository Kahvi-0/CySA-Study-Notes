## Domain 2.0 Vulnerability Management

Vulnerability management programs seek to identify, prioritize, and remediate these vulns before an attacker exploits them and comps one of the CIA of an information asset. Organized approach to scanning assets for vulns and using a defined workflow to remediate those vulns and preform contiued assesments to provide insight into the current state of the networks cybersecurity.

While a vuln mgmt plan is being developed, you need to first identify any internal or external requirements for vuln scanning. These may be regulatory environments where the org operates and/or internal policy-driven requirements.

### Regulatory Environment:
 
 Laws and regulations that govern how to store, process, and transmit info. Like handeling sensitive personal info or info belonging to gov agencies. 
HIPPA(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, how to handle health info)  and the GLBA(Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, how financial inst. may handle cust financial records) do not specifically address the implementation of a vuln mgmt program, they dont state that vuln scanning is required.

The PCI(Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) and FISMA(Federal Info Security Mgmt Act) do mandate the implementation of a vuln mgmt program.

  <summary>PCI DSS(Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)</summary>
  <br>
  - This is NOT a LAW, is maintained by the PCI SSC(Payment Card Industry Sec Standards Council) funded by industry to maintain req
  - Those subject to PCI DSS are by contract not law
  Specific security controls for merchs who that handle CC transactions and providers that assists with them. Includes arguably the most specific req for vuln scanning. 
  
  ## Included details for vuln scans
    - ORG must run internal and external scan (req 11.2)
    - run scans at least quarterly and after significant changes to network (new FW rule, system upgrade, new component (req 11.2)
    - Internal scans ran by qualified personal (req 11.2.1)
    - Org must remediate and high risk vuln and repeat scan to confirm they are resolved until a clean scan report (req 11.2.1)
    - External scan done by Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) auth by PCI SSC (req 11.2.2) (many org may conduct their own scans first to assure of a passing grade)

  <summary>FISMA(Federal Information Security Management)</summary>

  Security standards for gov agencies & Org on behalf of gov. The specific standards depend on if the gov designates the system as low, moderate, or high impact according to chart below. Furhter guidance in Federal Info Process Standards (FIPS) 199.

  All federal info systems regardless of impact must meet the basic req for vuln scanning found in NIST Special Publication 800-53: Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Info Systems and Orgs. These req that each org subject to FISMA:
  
  a. Scans for vulns in the info system and hosted apps when new vulns potentually affecting the system/app are reported
  b. Employ vuln scan tool and techniques that make it easier to have the systems tools work together and automate vuln mgmt process by using standards for:
    1. Enumerating paltforms, software flaws, & improper configs
    2. formatting checklist & test proc
    3. Measuring vuln impact
  c. Analyze vuln scan reportand results from sec control assessments.
  d. Remediate legit vuln in accordance wih an org assessment of risk
  e. Shares info obtained from the vuln scan process and sec control assessment to help eliminate similar vulns in other info systems (i.e systemic weakness or deficiencies)
