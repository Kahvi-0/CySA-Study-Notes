## Domain 2.0 Vulnerability Management

Vulnerability management programs seek to identify, prioritize, and remediate these vulns before an attacker exploits them and comps one of the CIA of an information asset. Organized approach to scanning assets for vulns and using a defined workflow to remediate those vulns and preform contiued assesments to provide insight into the current state of the networks cybersecurity.

While a vuln mgmt plan is being developed, you need to first identify any internal or external requirements for vuln scanning. These may be regulatory environments where the org operates and/or internal policy-driven requirements.

 <details>
 <summary>Regulatory Environment</summary>
 <br>
 
 Laws and regulations that govern how to store, process, and transmit info. Like handeling sensitive personal info or info belonging to gov agencies. 
HIPPA(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, how to handle health info)  and the GLBA(Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, how financial inst. may handle cust financial records) do not specifically address the implementation of a vuln mgmt program, they dont state that vuln scanning is required.

The PCI(Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) and FISMA(Federal Info Security Mgmt Act) do mandate the implementation of a vuln mgmt program.

These two cover org involved in processing retail tansactions and operating gov systems, this only covers a fraction of the enterprise. It is widely agreed that vuln mgmt is a critical component of any info security program, for this many org mandate vuln scanning in corporate policy , even if not imposed by regulatory requirements.

  <summary>PCI DSS(Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)</summary>
  <br>
  - This is NOT a LAW, is maintained by the PCI SSC(Payment Card Industry Sec Standards Council) funded by industry to maintain req
  - Those subject to PCI DSS are by contract not law
  Specific security controls for merchs who that handle CC transactions and providers that assists with them. Includes arguably the most specific req for vuln scanning. 
  
  ## Included details for vuln scans
    - ORG must run internal and external scan (req 11.2)
    - run scans at least quarterly and after significant changes to network (new FW rule, system upgrade, new component (req 11.2)
    - Internal scans ran by qualified personal (req 11.2.1)
    - Org must remediate and high risk vuln and repeat scan to confirm they are resolved until a clean scan report (req 11.2.1)
    - External scan done by Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) auth by PCI SSC (req 11.2.2) (many org may conduct their own scans first to assure of a passing grade)

  <summary>FISMA(Federal Information Security Management)</summary>

  Security standards for gov agencies & Org on behalf of gov. The specific standards depend on if the gov designates the system as low, moderate, or high impact according to chart below. Furhter guidance in Federal Info Process Standards (FIPS) 199.

  All federal info systems regardless of impact must meet the basic req for vuln scanning found in NIST Special Publication 800-53: Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Info Systems and Orgs. These req that each org subject to FISMA:
  
  a. Scans for vulns in the info system and hosted apps when new vulns potentually affecting the system/app are reported
  
  b. Employ vuln scan tool and techniques that make it easier to have the systems tools work together and automate vuln mgmt process by using standards for:
    1. Enumerating paltforms, software flaws, & improper configs
    2. formatting checklist & test proc
    3. Measuring vuln impact
    
  c. Analyze vuln scan reportand results from sec control assessments.
 
  d. Remediate legit vuln in accordance wih an org assessment of risk
  
  e. Shares info obtained from the vuln scan process and sec control assessment to help eliminate similar vulns in other info systems (i.e systemic weakness or deficiencies)
  
  */ These req est a baseline for all federal info sys. /* 
  
  NIST 800-53 then desc 8 control enhancements that may be req depending on the situation.
  
   1. Org uses vuln scan tools that include the ability to readily update the info systems vulns to be scanned
   2. Org updates vulns scanned prior to a new scan and/or when new vulns are identified and reported.
   3. Org employs vuln scanning procs that can identify the breadth and depth of coverage(i.e info system components scanned and vulns checked)
   4. Org determines what info about info systems is discoverable b adversaries and then takes org defined corrective actions.
   5. Info system implements priv access auth to info system components for selected vuln scanning activities.
   6. Org employs automated mechanisms to compare the results of vuln scans over time to determine trends in info system vulns.
   8. Org reviews historic audit logs to determine if an identified vuln has been previously exploited.
   10. Org correlates the output from vuln scanning tools to determine the resence of multi-vuln/ multi-hop attack vectors.
   
   */ req 7 & 9 were control enhancements that were once included but since have been with drawn. /*
   
   If federal agency determines an info system falls under the moderate impact, it must implement 1,2, and 5 at a minimum
   If it falls under high impact then 1,2,4, and 5.

An organization has decided to conduct a vulnerability scan:
 - must check if they fall under any regulatory requirments
 - next step is to identify targets covered in the scan
 - some choose all where as some choose based on the following questions
   - data classicfication of data being stored, processed or stored?
   - Is there system exposed to the internet/public/semi-public networks?
   - what service is offered on the system?
   - Is the system prod, test, or dev?

Orgs may use automated ways to identify systems that may be coverd in a scan. May use tools to search the network for connected systems wheather previously known or not. They then can build an asset inventory. QualysGuard offers such a function called asset map. Then adding info the the assets in the map. Asset info and critical info helps guide the types of scans and there freq as well as priority admins shoud place on the vulns detected in the scan. Orgs may decide to automate vuln scans.
